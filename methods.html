<h1>Methods: Extracting Data</h1>
</div>
<div id="text">
Data excluded from Twitter:
<ul>
<li>Posts within the last 7 days</li>
<li>Replies</li>
<li>Quote retweets</li>
<li>Text tweets without media</li>
</ul><p>
The <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rtweet/"><mono>rtweet</mono></a> library is used to access the Twitter API. Tweets less than 7 days old are excluded from the analysis to allow time for their numbers to stabilize. It has been observed that replies, quote retweets, and text tweets garner significantly less engagement than simple media tweets. Therefore, the analysis includes only media tweets. Tweets with 0 likes or retweets are given 1 like or retweet in order to avoid undetermined values when taking the logarithm. The number of tweets affected by this intervention is insignificant.
<p>
Data excluded from Instagram:
<ul>
<li>Posts within the last 7 days</li>
</ul><p>
The <a href="https://instaloader.github.io/"><mono>instaloader</mono></a> command line tool is used to access the Instagram API. Instagram posts less than 7 days old are excluded from the analysis to allow time for their numbers to stabilize. Posts that disable likes are excluded from the analysis. Posts that disable comments are included in the analysis as 0 comments. This is because it is impossible to distinguish posts with comments disabled from those with comments enabled. A method to exclude posts with statistically low comment to like ratio is being investigated to circumvent this.
<p>
The average value of likes, retweets and comments is derived using different methods based on the number of data points in order to avoid overfitting. For greater than 50 data points, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression">LOESS regression</a> is performed. For between 2 and 50 data points, linear regression is performed. For 1 data point, the value itself is taken. The regressions are performed on the base-10 logarithms of the engagement over time. No extrapolation is performed, so if the data date is more recent than the latest post, then the value of the regression at the time of the latest post is taken. The ratio of comments to likes is calculated as the difference of the regressions of the log base-10 of the comments and likes respectively.

<h1>Methods: Combined Analysis</h1>
</div>
<div id="text">
Twitter and Instagram stats are combined using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</a>. The PCA is performed to reduce the two dimensions, log of IG likes and log of Twt likes, into one dimension that provides a kind of weighted average (defined by the eigenvector). The average value, called <mono>igtwt_avg</mono>, is derived from PC1 and scaled to a range of 0 to 1. For individuals with just a Twitter or Instagram account but not both, the missing data is estimated before inclusion in the PCA. Missing data is estimated using the linear regression of the log of IG likes vs. the log of Twt likes.
