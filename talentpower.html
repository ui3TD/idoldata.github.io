<h4>What are the Talent Power Rankings?</h4>
<p>The Talent Power Rankings is a yearly survey of celebrity "Recognition" and "Interest". Recognition is usually plotted on the horizontal x axis and Interest is plotted on the vertical y axis. The survey is run by Architect, a marketing company, and is published in Nikkei Entertainment monthly magazine. It has been published every May since 2008.</p>
<h4>What do these numbers mean?</h4>
<p>Recognition is the number of people reached by the celebrity throughout their career. This number should usually increase with each year. It is not representative of the current trendiness of a celebrity. Be careful to note that Recognition for groups behaves differently than for individuals! Unlike individuals, groups can change their members. It is very easy for groups to decrease in Recognition if their members have changed.</p>
<p>Interest is the proportion of people who feel mildly positively towards a celebrity, among those who know the celebrity. It is wider in scope than just fans of a celebrity. This number should vary year after year depending on the celebrity's activities. If you multiply Recognition and Interest, you get the total percentage of people who are mildly interested in a celebrity!</p>
<p>Is low Interest bad? Usually, but not necessarily. If it comes with increasing Recognition, it could represent a new audience who have the potential to be converted to fans. If Recognition is stagnant however, it could represent a loss of fanbase. The graphs do not show the rate of change of Recognition so you will have to judge based on your knowledge of the industry.</p>
<p>Celebrities toward the top right of the graph are famous nationwide and generally well-regarded. Celebrities toward the bottom right are famous but have relatively poor public opinion. Celebrities toward the top left have strong cult followings. Celebrities toward the bottom left are neither well-known nor well-liked.</p>
<h4>Who is surveyed?</h4>
<p>The survey polls people in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba. A total of 4400 people are polled, split between 4 groups so that 1100 people are polled each quarter of the year. Each quarter, the following number of people are polled per age group, split between male (M) and female (F):
<ul>
<li>Ages 10-14 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 15-19 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 20-24 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 25-29 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 30-34 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 35-39 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 40-44 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 45-49 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 50-54 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 55-59 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
<li>Ages 60-69 (50 M / 50 F)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each participant evaluates 320 celebrities out of a total list of 1280. This means that over the course of a year, each celebrity receives 1100 votes.</p>
</p>
<h4>How is the survey biased?</h4>
<p>The survey will probably under-represent celebrities who are popular outside of the Tokyo region. Among survey participants, young people between 10-35 years old are over-represented, older people between 35-60 years old are under-represented, seniors between 60-70 years old are greatly under-represented, seniors aged 70+ (20% of Japan's population) are not represented at all. The survey only includes a curated selection of celebrities. Some popular celebrities, especially new up-and-coming celebrities, may be excluded. </p>
<h4>How is "Recognition" determined?</h4>
<p>Participants are asked to choose between 3 options for each celebrity:</p>
<ol>
<li>I know their name and face</li>
<li>I only know their name</li>
<li>I don't know them</li>
</ol>
<p>Recognition is the percentage who choose option 1.</p>
<h4>How is "Interest" determined?</h4>
<p>Participants who answer with option 1 to the Recognition question are then are asked to choose between 4 options for each celebrity:</p>
<ol>
<li>I really want to see, listen to or hear about them</li>
<li>I want to see, listen to or hear about them</li>
<li>I don't want to see, listen to or hear about them</li>
<li>I really don't want to see, listen to or hear about them</li>
</ol>
<p>Interest is the percentage, among those who recognize the celebrity, who choose option 1 or 2. Thus, Interest is the percentage who feel at least mildly positively towards the celebrity.</p>
<h4>What is "Talent Power Score"?</h4>
<p>What if you want to know not the number of people mildly interested but rather the number of fans? This is what the talent power score is. You often see this number in rankings. This is a rough estimation of the percent of participants who are fans of the celebrity. It assumes one third of the people who answered option 2 to the Interest question are fans. It is calculated by multiplying the Recognition with the sum of the percent of people who chose option 1 for Interest, and one third of those who chose option 2 for Interest.</p>

<h4>What is the accuracy of the survey?</h4>
<p>The error of Recognition is observable to be approximately +/- 5%. This was determined assuming that Recognition is expected to increase year after year. Under this assumption, if a celebrity has decreased in recognition over a year, then we can assume that decrease is largely due to sampling error. A singer named Superfly decreased in Recognition by approximately 5% between 2021 and 2022. Statistically, the error is expected to decrease if the value is near the extremes (near 0% and near 100%)</p>
<p>The error of Interest is difficult to estimate. Celebrities with lower Recognition will have greater error in Interest values because of lower sample size.</p>
<p>The error of the Talent Power Score is likewise difficult to estimate. It can be roughly estimated to be between +/- 5-10 points, assuming the error of Interest is approximately the same as that of Recognition.</p>
<h4>Example Case: Endo Sakura</h4>
<p>Let's take Endo Sakura in 2022 as an example case. Over the course of 2021, 1100 people submitted survey answers for her. Of those people, 188 said that they know her name and face. 188/1100 is 17%, which is her Recognition. If we consider the error, then her Recognition is 17% +/- 5%. Those 188 people are asked about their interest in her. 94 people said they are very interested in her, 56 people said they were mildly interested and 37 people said they have negative interest. 80% of them showed some interest so that is her Interest value. If we multiply Recognition (17%) and Interest (80%) we get 13.6%, which is the percent of all people who have positive interest in her. If we multiply Recognition (80%) and the sum of very interested people and one third of mildly interested people (50% + 30% / 3) then we have 10.2%, which is her power score. An estimated 10.2% of all people are her fans. Don't forget a rough error of up to 5-10%.</p>
<p>The error values shown above are rough estimates. With these exact numbers, using statistical methods, we can calculate more precise errors for any given confidence interval. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. ðŸ™‚</p>
